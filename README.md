<h3>Therefore, the device was created to help reduce the problem of gas leaks and contribute to fires in particular.</h3>
<h6>btw, this device is still a demo. There are still some parts that we need to improve.</h6>
<h2>In the future, if this device is really available for sale I believe that it will definitely become a device that will greatly increase the safety of our lives. (29 Oct 2022)</h2>
